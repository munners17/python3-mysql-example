Using Flask on Python 3 with MySQL

This demo shows an example "list" and "detail" page which are very common in web applications.  The pages read from a table in a MySQL database.  This will need a created database and table with data in order to function.  Look at the mysql-test.py for MySQL database config and queries in order to configure the db and table schema properly.
